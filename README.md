The objective of this project is to build an end to end web application powered by Scrapy and Wix, where the users will get the latest updates in the music industry. We are crawling the public website of the "The Rolling Stones Magazine" for the latest news. Further plans is to use the data we are getting in obtaining the latest updates/information about the artists in the news from Spotify and Wikipedia. 

For this we plan to use the Spotify API(REST Based) and the related Wiki pages.
