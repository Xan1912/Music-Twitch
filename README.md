*********************
PROJECT IDEA
********************

The objective of this project is to build an end to end web application powered by Scrapy and Django, where the users will get the latest updates in the music industry. We are crawling the public website of the "The Rolling Stones Magazine" for the latest news. Further plans is to use the data we are getting in obtaining the latest updates/information about the artists in the news from Spotify and Wikipedia. 

For this we plan to use the Spotify API(REST Based) and the related Wiki pages.

We are using a MySQL database.


****************** 
CURRENT STATUS
*****************
We have the news data from the website. 
We have set up the Database.
We are working on crawling the data from the inner URLS. This will be important for making requests for the Spotify API.

We have set up the Spotify API and obtained the necessary tokens to fetch data.

Next objective would be to integrate the Spotify and the Crawler and deploy it on a Django based platform.
